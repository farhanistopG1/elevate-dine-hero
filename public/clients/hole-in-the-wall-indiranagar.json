    "title": "Our Story: More Than Just a Cafe",
    "paragraph1": "It all started in 2009 with a simple idea: to create a cozy nook in Bangalore serving delicious, homemade continental food that feels like a warm hug. The Hole in the Wall Cafe was born from a passion for quality ingredients, hearty meals, and creating a place where everyone, including your furry friends, feels right at home.",
    "paragraph2": "From our first small cafe, we've grown into a beloved city institution with multiple locations, but our core mission remains the same. We're still that friendly neighbourhood spot for lazy breakfasts and comforting food. Love our flavours? You can even take a piece of our magic home with ingredients from our dedicated sister brand."
